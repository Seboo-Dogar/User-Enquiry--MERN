# 📝 User Inquiry Form - MERN Stack Project

This is a simple full-stack **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to submit inquiries via a form. The submitted data is stored in a MongoDB database, and displayed in a responsive table format with **Edit** and **Delete** functionalities.

This project was created as a hands-on practice to strengthen MERN stack skills, and utilizes modern libraries such as **TailwindCSS**, **Flowbite**, **React Toastify**, and **Axios**.
